# Skynode Shell

A shell program used for use within my Skynode cluster of servers. It is a collection of programs and Bash scripts, written in Bash and JavaScript. I decided to make this public as I thought that this would be useful for others.

## How do I use Skynode Shell?
Skynode Shell can be used with the binaries or it can be used plain with Node. Skynode Shell is modularised, meaning that it can be used mix-and-match and each module is its' own app, meaning that it can even be used standalone (perhaps with other operating systems, too).

## Where can I find Skynode Shell binaries?
Skynode Shell binaries can be found [here](https://ci.bean.codes/danny/skynode-shell/-/releases).

### I don't trust these binaries. Can I build the project myself?
Although the binaries don't have any spyware or malware, I can see why you'd want to build yourself. There's a handy little Node app in the `build` directory that'll automatically build the binaries for you. Just run `node [name of build script]` and you'll be on your way! :)
