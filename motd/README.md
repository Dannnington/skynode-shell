# MOTD
This module is meant to be used as a replacement for Ubuntu's update-motd PAM module, which provides a method to use Bash scripts within the MOTD. However, this module also supports Node.js scripts, for added capability.

## How do I install this module?
These instructions are in the README.md in the base of the repository.
